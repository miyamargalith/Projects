In this exercise we added the car from the previous exercise.
We added the colours for the day and night scene as we thought was fitted.
We used Moav tutorials for the first part.
We positioned the car and both cameraâ€™s view, and made sure it moves with the cars movement.
We added the front lights as a strong bright light source as in our cars so we can see the road clearly and avoid accidents.
